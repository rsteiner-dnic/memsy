# Memsy 

A durable memcache replacement


## Overview

Memsy (prouncned mem-c as in memcached) is a wire compatible memcache replacement written in go, it is in memory but simultaneously backs to disk, if the process is restarted the disk cache is reloaded into memory.

Memsy also allows you to create a cluster of peers that will keep in sync with each other.  Each install needs to just reference the others, not mandatory to use

## Configuration

Memsy is configured on the command line

```
  -cachedir string
    	Location directory for memsy db (default "/var/cache")
  -comport string
    	TCP port number for communication (default "1180")
  -debug
    	Debug settings
  -expireinterval string
    	How often to clear expired items (default "17m") //should not be divisble by syncinterval, otherwise you are potentially syncing records at the same time as your are expiring them.
  -listen string
    	Interface to listen on. Default to all addresses. (default "0.0.0.0")
  -peers string
    	Comma separated list of servers to peer with
  -port int
    	TCP port number to listen on (default 11211)
  -syncinterval string
    	How often to sync all records to other nodes (default "30m") Note: All records are synced as they come in, this covers old records, etc
  -threads int
    	Number of threads to use (default 2)
   
```
        
Note: the comport and port #'s must be the same on all peers for syncing to work

## Install

Copy the memsy binary to your server and run

```
./memsy --peers=1.2.3.4,4.3.2.1 --port=11212
```

## Building from source

cd to directory and then run "go build"

## FAQ

- Q: How does syncing work
- A: When a set request comes in it's batched in groups (using a rate limit algorithm) and copied to all peers configured (this reduces connection overhead to peers), every syncinterval all keys are sent to peer nodes and diff'd, what doesn't match is sent to the peer. This is also done on startup and periodically.

- Q: What is the protocol for syncing
- A: The key diffing protocl using tcp, once the list of keys is determined the keys/values are sent using memcache protocol itself
